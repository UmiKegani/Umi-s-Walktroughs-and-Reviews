                            It is inevitable that you will be taking hits to your health, but unlike other games, Sifu has no consumables present to help you recover lost health. Instead, the game does this a couple of ways; firstly, by interacting with shrines as this would heal you up completely, and secondly by rewarding you with health for each takedown. The amount healed through takedowns can be increased through the skill tree.                        </div>

                            Enemy attacks may be blocked, deflected or avoided; attacks that are deflected will increase your structure by a smaller amount relative to blocked attacks while avoiding attacks regains your structure instead. As your structure gradually reaches its threshold, any attack blocked that would take the gauge up to the threshold will break through your guard and will be treated as if you haven’t blocked in the first place. It is worth noting that deflecting attacks while at the structure gauge threshold will prevent it from going any further. You would know than an attack has been deflected if there are white "petal" effects after each hit.                </div>

Investing more XP into move sets and focus attacks will eventually make them permanently unlocked.

                            As the deaths you have accumulated gradually increase your age, the game limits the number of deaths by capping it when you reach 70 years old. When you die with at least an age of 70, you will no longer respawn. No need to worry as you will be given the option to restart the location; this will reset your age, death counter, and learned skills and perks to what it was prior to choosing the location.                         </div>

                            Holding down the guard button will allow for you to block an attack and negate any unarmed damage while greatly decreasing any weapon damage. The structure gauge does increase significantly more relative to a deflect or parry.                     </div>

                            Pressing the guard button right before an attack is about to land will deflect the attack, this lets you avoid any damage while only slightly increasing your structure gauge as well as greatly increasing the enemy’s structure gauge. Doing the same to certain attacks in an enemy’s attack string would result in a parry where the aforementioned effects of a deflect applies on top of stunning an enemy, leaving them open for you to deal damage back to them.                     </div>

                            Holding down the guard button and inputting an Up, Left, or Right directional input will result in a duck/high avoid while inputting a Down directional input will result in a hop/low avoid. This completely negates any damage or increase in structure and will help to regain your structure. Avoiding the last hit in an enemy’s attack string will slow down time for a brief moment leaving them open to any form of retaliation.                     </div>

                            Being able to choose between these three main defensive tools is vital in your gameplay as these open the enemies up to attacks of your own. Despite blocking having several downsides that the other defensive options lack, this does not mean that this should be completely avoided especially as you are growing accustomed to the combat of the game. Blocking can help when you don’t have the time to react, giving you a small window to assess the attacks being thrown at you so you can react accordingly before your structure gauge breaks.                      </div>

                            Generally, once you have grown familiar with the attack patterns of the enemies, deflecting and parrying tends to be easier and rewarding as the enemy’s structure gauge rises while avoiding leaves them open to your attacks. It is worth noting that several attack strings may end with a special attack that is a 50/50 between a high or low attack, in this instance it is generally safer to learn the timings of these attacks as they are both the same instead of having to react.                </div>

                        Enemies will attempt to crowd around you to overwhelm you with attacks. Be aware that regardless of the amount of people around you, at any given time only two will actively attack you at any given while the others watch on, although the enemies chosen to attack you can change over time making it feel as if there are multiple attacking you at once. Being able to manage these waves of enemies are important and can be done through the following: </div>

                            The simplest way is to knock enemies down either through command attacks, certain attack strings, or certain throwable items. Throwing or pushing an enemy into one that is already knocked down could be knocked down as well. They stay on the ground for a while, giving you time to deal with everyone else in the room.                     </div>

                            Attacking enemies can put them in a dizzy state, stopping them from performing any actions for a short while. When the enemy has been damaged enough, then certain actions can instead stun an enemy leaving them immobile for longer; this can be achieved through certain skills, having another enemy thrown at them, or when interrupting an attack; an interrupted attack would generally keep them immobile for longer.                     </div>
