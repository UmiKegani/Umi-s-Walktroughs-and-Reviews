                            Vaulting over the fence to your right you will come across two guards, these are the enemy types you will be seeing the most of throughout the rest of your time with the game, it is worth noting that these types are completely susceptible to the sweep command attack. Rush down the first guard so they do not have an opportunity to stack against you and quickly deal with the second one.                        </div>

                            Here you are greeted with two options. I would recommend that you take the path on the left for your first time as this would lead to one of the items on your board. Continue straight until you find a locked door and interact with the lovely note left on it. Interact with the door after. Keep these in mind as you play.                    </div>

                            Before heading up the stairs, you may head to the room adjacent to the stairs. Here you’ll find weapons you can pick up; it is recommended to pick up the pipe as this would make clearing the building simpler. You may now head up the stairs and deal with everyone on each floor, the game does ease you in with spreading them out into groups of 2 at the most. It is worth noting that rushing them down before they have a chance to react will instantly stun them for a takedown.                </div>

                            At the top of the building, you’ll find a pile of boards conveniently placed leading to the adjacent building, run out the window and jump into the next building. As you land you will find a room with three enemies, it is recommended to deal with the guy on the left close to the counter first.

                            Before continuing, I’d recommend grabbing a bottle. Behind this door is the most iconic part of Sifu, an homage to the movie Oldboy. Slowly approach them until a dialogue option pops up, choose the one that you like the most. Right before you could finish your dialogue you can choose to throw the bottle and that would instantly stun the guy nearest to you for a free takedown. For the rest of this section, try to knock down the enemies holding on to pipes so you can grab a hold of their weapons; that would make it easier to get through the hallway.                          </div>

                            At the end of the hallway is the door out of this area. Follow the stairs up, open the door, and go down the next hallway. From here it is recommended to take the first door to your left where you will find two enemies. Be aware that one not sitting on the couch may grab a bottle and throw it at you so be attentive to the sound cue.                           </div>

                            There are several options to continue from here but all would lead you to an open area with multiple enemies. Be aware of the one that has a bottle that would instantly throw it at you once you’re spotted. In here you would be introduced to your first instance of “powered up” enemies/mini bosses, these are enemies that would fight back against the first takedown attempt done to them and are outlined with a glowing effect; they are significantly harder to beat than their previous non “powered up” counterparts as they have access to special attacks that quickly drain your structure and can deal a lot of damage.                           </div>

                            You will see a large room with numerous enemies. It is a fairly open space so reposition if you need to. Wait for the dialogue to finish and go down to the hallway on your left, attack the guy as his back is turned towards you and get an instant takedown. There’s also a pipe located on the table if you need a weapon. Note that there is a chance to trigger another mini boss in this room so be aware of that when performing takedowns.

In here are two mini bosses, having a weapon here would make the fight more manageable. Focus on dealing with one of them at a time. After beating them you will automatically find a bunch of keys and another shrine.                     </div>

                            Go back through the hallway and use the keys on the locked metal gate. Going through the next door you will find a lot of enemies in the warehouse. There are several you can take out without having to alert the rest of them. Take down the first enemy walking up the stairs in front of you, go down the stairs where she came from and take down the one distracted with a phone, go back up the stairs and head to the walkway on your left and sneak behind the one with her back turned towards you, and then go all the way back until you reach the door you came from. Go to the right and vault over the pile of boxes, hug the railing on the right as you hop down and spam your attack buttons. If done perfectly you would take out all four without alerting the rest of the warehouse.                      </div>
